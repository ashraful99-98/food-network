            <p>Hi, I am food bloger. Food blogging represents a complex interweaving of “foodie” or gourmet interest in
                cooking with those of blog writing and photography. The majority of blogs use pictures taken by the
                author himself/herself and some of them focus specifically on food photography</p>
